# Random File Copier
This program facilitates copying random Audio/Video/Picture files. Random File Copier is also capable of copying random folders. Installation info can be found on the bottom off the page ! 
So this program can be used to copy random movies and also to copy random MP3 or other music filetypes, even to copy random tv series (here you will use the folder selection)

# How does it work?
Start Random File Copier
* Choose the type you want to copy
* Select a source folder
* Define any search options or selection options (note the selection options minimum maximum amount is for a single file)
* Select a destination folder
* Select the amount of data you want to copy
* Click the search button to search for the selected file type and wait for files to be found
* Click Start Copy to start copying files
* Enjoy your copied Video/Audio/Folders!

A usecase i often use it for is to move many files to a single folder. For instance, you have multiple picture files scattered over multiple folders and want to put them together in one folder and remove duplicates. In order to use it like this just select the parent folder containing the child folders, as the destination folder choose the folder where you want to copy it too. Make sure to put the maximum amount of data to be copied and hit the Search button followed by the Start Copy button.
